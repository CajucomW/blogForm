# Blog Form

A simple, Django-powered form I learned about from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstartcoding.com">KickStart Coding</a> bootcamp. It's a feature that I'd love to, eventually, flesh out and add to my site.

The purpose of the app was to practice using django forms and models and styling was intentionally left out.

To run the app:

- clone the repo
- in terminal run
    <code>pipenv shell</code>
    <code>python3 manage.py runserver</code>
- once finished, open up browser to localhost:8000
